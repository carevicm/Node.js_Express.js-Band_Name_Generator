Band Name Generator with Express.js

Dive into the world of Express.js with the Band Name Generator, a fun and interactive web application that crafts unique band names based on user input.


Welcome to the Band Name Generator! This application is designed to provide users with a unique band name based on their input. By combining the name of a street and a pet, we generate a band name that's both fun and memorable.


What Powers Our Application?

Express.js: The backbone of our application. This robust framework ensures efficient request handling and seamless page serving.

Body-Parser: An essential middleware that decodes the data sent by users, ensuring accurate band name generation.

Morgan: Our trusty logging tool. It keeps an eye on server requests, ensuring everything runs smoothly.

Postman: Although not directly part of the app, we recommend using Postman for testing our API endpoints. It's a developer's best friend!
