# Node.js_Express.js-Band_Name_Generator

Band Name Generator - Middleware Application
Hello there! Welcome to the Band Name Generator.

What's Under The Hood?
Express.js: The heart of our application. This lightweight framework helps us serve up pages in a jiffy.

Body-Parser: Helps us in decoding the data you send us.

Morgan: We use this for logging server requests. It's like our tiny watch guard!

Postman: While this isn't directly in the app, we highly recommend using Postman if you're planning to test our API endpoints.


Setting Things Up

So you've decided to take it for a spin? Awesome! Here's how you can get things up and running:

First things first. Hop on to your terminal and clone repository.

Once you're in, the next step is to install all our node. Simply run:

npm install

Fire up the server with:

nodemon index.js

Band Name Generator should now be jamming at http://localhost:3000/
